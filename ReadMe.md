# D4pi: Diablo4 Item Filter

[D4pi](https://d4pi.com/) is a free, safety-first,
[open-source](https://github.com/d4pi/web-app), fan-made, Diablo4 Item
Filter web app.

[Demo](https://d4pi.com/) - https://d4pi.com/ (hassle-free,
click-and-go!)

# Safety First

* D4pi **never** directly interfaces with Diablo4's game program -- D4pi
  deals with only user-supplied screenshots.
* D4pi by default operates entirely inside its user's web browser --
  D4pi has only limited access to its user's computer.
* D4pi is open-source -- D4pi can be audited and/or self-hosted.

Thank you.
